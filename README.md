# Sudoku3D

A solvable 3D sudoku board layed out onto all 6 faces of a cube. Made in Unity.

* Each face has a 4x4 grid of numbers.
* The goal is to make each face and every possible ring on the X, Y, and Z axes to contain the numbers 1-16, each exactly once.
* The rings on the X axis are differentiated by the numbers either being regular font, bold, italic, or both bold and italic.
* The rings on the Y axis are differentiated by the color of the background behind the number.
* The rings on the Z axis are differentiated by the color of the font itself.
* Rotate the cube with click-and-drag, and click on any cell to enter a new number for that cell.
